# Breast-Cancer-Classification-
Breast cancer classification project using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest). Data pre-processing performed to clean noisy data, and models compared to identify the most accurate and efficient predictor.

# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms to classify and predict breast cancer cases based on clinical data.

## 📊 Data Pre-processing
- Collected raw dataset and removed dirty/noisy data.
- Cleaned, labeled, and transformed the dataset for training and testing.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
Implemented and compared the following algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Each model was trained and evaluated for **accuracy** and **execution time**.
- The model with the highest accuracy and lowest computational cost was selected as the **best-fitted model** for prediction.

## 🚀 Outcome
The final selected model provides reliable breast cancer classification and prediction, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in healthcare.
